• You may Discover a Cure at any Research Station — the color of its
city does not need to match the disease you are curing.

• On your turn, you may take a card from another player, if you are both
in the city that matches the card you are taking.

• On your turn, you may take any City card from the Researcher (only), if you are both in the same city.
