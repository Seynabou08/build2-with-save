Player save and load must used switch case (maybe) to turn string to cards.

Must change way deck is saved by saving simply the card ID.

Then use that in load player. (get id then make player draw card with that ID)



//Getting the Pawn
			//getline(myfile, lineToBeInputed, ' ');
			//char line = lineToBeInputed;


What cards get in the deck??? I need to know for loading 
if(s=="city card")
				
	{
					
		cards.push_back(d.at(j));
	}
