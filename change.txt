Implement role cards:
Done: Quarantine Specialist, Operations Expert, Researcher, Scientist, Medic (first 2 effects)

Incomplete: 
Contigency Planner may take an Event card from anywhere in the Player Discard Pile and place it on his Role card. 
Only 1 Event card can be on his role card at a time. It does not count against his hand limit.
When the Contingency Planner plays the Event card on his role card,
remove this Event card from the game (instead of discarding it).
Dispatcher (half done)

Implement some of the commonly overlooked rules (in pdf):
• You do not draw a replacement card after drawing an Epidemic card.

• You may Discover a Cure at any Research Station — the color of its
city does not need to match the disease you are curing.

• On your turn, you may take a card from another player, if you are both
in the city that matches the card you are taking.

• On your turn, you may take any City card from the Researcher (only), if you are both in the same city.

• Your hand limit applies immediately after getting a card from another player.
